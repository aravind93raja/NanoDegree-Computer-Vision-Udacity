# NanoDegree Program on COMPUTER VISION 

## Collection of Projects part of the [Computer Vision NanoDegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/computer-vision-nanodegree--nd891) program by Udacity

The furthur details for every project :

1) Setup & Build Instruction

2) Sample Results 

have been provided in the README.md of each repository 

### 1) Project - Facial Keypoint Detection

Use image processing techniques and deep learning techniques
to detect faces in an image and find facial keypoints, such as the
position of the eyes, nose, and mouth on a face.
This project tests your knowledge of image processing and
feature extraction techniques that allow you to programmatically
represent different facial features. Youâ€™ll also use your knowledge
of deep learning techniques to program a convolutional neural
network to recognize facial keypoints. Facial keypoints include
points around the eyes, nose, and mouth on any face and are used
in many applications, from facial
tracking to emotion recognition.

### 2) Project - Image Captioning

Combine CNN and RNN knowledge to build a deep learning model
that produces captions given an input image.
Image captioning requires that you create a complex deep learning
model with two components: a CNN that transforms an input
image into a set of features, and an RNN that turns those features
into rich, descriptive language. In this project, you will implement
these cutting-edge deep learning architectures.

### 3) Project - SLAM

Use feature detection and keypoint descriptors to build a map
of the environment with SLAM (simultaneous localization and
mapping).
Implement a robust method for tracking an object over time, using
elements of probability, motion models, and linear algebra. This
project tests your knowledge of localization techniques that are
widely used in autonomous vehicle navigation.
